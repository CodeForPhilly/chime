$\\gamma$ is the inverse of the mean recovery time, in days.  I.e.: if $\\gamma = 1/{recovery_days}$, then the average infection will clear in {recovery_days} days.

An important descriptive parameter is the _basic reproduction number_, or $R_0$.  This represents the average number of people who will be infected by any given infected person.

$R_0$ gets bigger when

- there are more contacts between people
- when the pathogen is more virulent
- when people have the pathogen for longer periods of time

A doubling time of {doubling_time} days and a recovery time of {recovery_days} days imply an $R_0$ of {r_naught:.2f}.

#### Effect of social distancing

After the beginning of the outbreak, actions to reduce social contact will lower the parameter $c$.  If this happens at
time $t$, then the number of people infected by any given infected person is $R_t$, which will be lower than $R_0$.

A {relative_contact_rate:.0%} reduction in social contact would increase the time it takes for the outbreak to double,
to {doubling_time_t:.2f} days from {doubling_time:.2f} days, with a $R_t$ of {r_t:.2f}.

#### Using the model

We need to express the two parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ in terms of quantities we can estimate.

- $\\gamma$:  the CDC is recommending 14 days of self-quarantine, we'll use $\\gamma = 1/{recovery_days}$.
- To estimate $$\\beta$$ directly, we'd need to know transmissibility and social contact rates.  since we don't know these things, we can extract it from known _doubling times_.  The AHA says to expect a doubling time $T_d$ of 7-10 days. That means an early-phase rate of growth can be computed by using the doubling time formula:

* **Doubling Time (days):** This parameter drives the rate of new cases during the early phases of the outbreak. The American Hospital Association currently projects doubling rates between 7 and 10 days. This is the doubling time you expect under status quo conditions. To account for reduced contact and other public health interventions, modify the _Social distancing_ input.
* **Social distancing (% reduction in person-to-person physical contact):** This parameter allows users to explore how reduction in interpersonal contact & transmission (hand-washing) might slow the rate of new infections. It is your estimate of how much social contact reduction is being achieved in your region relative to the status quo. While it is unclear how much any given policy might affect social contact (eg. school closures or remote work), this parameter lets you see how projections change with percentage reductions in social contact.
* **Hospitalization %(total infections):** Percentage of **all** infected cases which will need hospitalization.
* **ICU %(total infections):** Percentage of **all** infected cases which will need to be treated in an ICU.
* **Ventilated %(total infections):** Percentage of **all** infected cases which will need mechanical ventilation.
* **Hospital Length of Stay:** Average number of days of treatment needed for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
* **ICU Length of Stay:** Average number of days of ICU treatment needed for ICU COVID-19 patients.
* **Vent Length of Stay:**  Average number of days of ventilation needed for ventilated COVID-19 patients.
* **Hospital Market Share (%):** The proportion of patients in the region that are likely to come to your hospital (as opposed to other hospitals in the region) when they get sick. One way to estimate this is to look at all of the hospitals in your region and add up all of the beds. The number of beds at your hospital divided by the total number of beds in the region times 100 will give you a reasonable starting estimate.
* **Regional Population:** Total population size of the catchment region of your hospital(s).
* **Currently Known Regional Infections**: The number of infections reported in your hospital's catchment region. This is only used to compute detection rate - **it will not change projections**. This input is used to estimate the detection rate of infected individuals.
