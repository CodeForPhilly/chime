<!--
Please note: Any changes to the model have a huge impact on rapidly evolving hospital system & public health decisions. The current model has been in use for a while now, and it has been validated against other similar models, so any changes to the model must meet a very high bar.

However, these 2 types of issue reports are very welcome:
- Bugs causing this model to produce invalid results. In this case, please include details and a suggested fix.
- If this model is producing a significantly different result than another well-known epidemiological model. In this case, please include proof of this difference and a suggested fix to our approach.

For questions or early discussion, please join us in [#chime-analysis](https://codeforphilly.org/chat?channel=chime-analysis) in Slack instead.
