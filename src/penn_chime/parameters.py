# Parameters for each disposition (hospitalized, icu, ventilated)
#   The rate of disposition within the population of infected

# ICU:
#   0.75 percent of the infected population are in the ICU: icu.rate is 0.0075

# Ventilated:
#   0.5 percent of the infected population are on a ventilator: ventilated.rate is 0.005
#   Average number of days on a ventilator: ventilated.days = 10

# Be sure to multiply by 100 when using the parameter as a default to a percent widget!
