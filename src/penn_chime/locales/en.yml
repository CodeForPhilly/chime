  presentation-notice: |+

    **Notice**: CHIME is a modified [SIR](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SIRModel.html) model of outbreak progression that is limited to short term forecasting.
    It is only applicable during the period prior to a region’s peak infections, and it accounts only for a single significant social distancing policy.
    Penn Medicine is actively developing [BayesCHIME](https://github.com/pennsignals/chime_sims/blob/master/README.md) to make use of more data and provide probabilistic forecasts beyond peak infections.
  presentation-developed-by: |+
    This tool was developed by [Predictive Healthcare](http://predictivehealthcare.pennmedicine.org/) at
    Penn Medicine to assist hospitals and public health officials with hospital capacity planning.
    Please read [How to Use CHIME]({docs_url}) to customize inputs for your region.
    The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Forecasting Calculator was developed collaboratively by
    the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Medicine.
  presentation-estimated-number-of-infection: |+
    The estimated number of currently infected individuals is **{total_infections:.0f}**. This is based on current inputs for
    Hospitalizations (**{current_hosp}**), Hospitalization rate (**{hosp_rate:.0%}**), Regional population (**{S}**),
    and Hospital market share (**{market_share:.0%}**).

    {infected_population_warning_str}

    An initial doubling time of **{doubling_time}** days and a recovery time of **{recovery_days}** days imply an $R_0$ of
    **{r_naught:.2f}** and daily growth rate of **{daily_growth:.2f}%**.

    {mitigation_str}
  presentation-mitigation-rt-less-then-1: |+
    **Mitigation**: A **{relative_contact_rate:.0%}** reduction in social contact after the onset of the
    outbreak **halves the infections every {doubling_time_t:.1f}** days, implying an effective $R_t$ of **${r_t:.2f}$**
    and daily growth rate of **{daily_growth_t:.2f}%**.
  presentation-mitigation-rt-more-then-equal-1: |+
    **Mitigation**: A **{relative_contact_rate:.0%}** reduction in social contact after the onset of the
    outbreak **reduces the doubling time to {doubling_time_t:.1f}** days, implying an effective $R_t$ of **${r_t:.2f}$**
    and daily growth rate of **{daily_growth_t:.2f}%**.
