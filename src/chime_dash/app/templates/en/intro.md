The estimated number of currently infected individuals is **{total_infections:.0f}**. This is based on current inputs for
    Hospitalizations (**{current_hosp}**), Hospitalization rate (**{hosp_rate:.0%}**), Regional population (**{S}**),
    and Hospital market share (**{market_share:.0%}**).

An initial doubling time of **{doubling_time}** days and a recovery time of **{recovery_days}** days imply an **`R0`** of
 **{r_naught:.2f}** and daily growth rate of **{daily_growth:.2f}%**.

**Mitigation**: A **{relative_contact_rate:.0%}** reduction in social contact after the onset of the
outbreak **{impact_statement:s} {doubling_time_t:.1f}** days, implying an effective **`R(t)`** of **{r_t:.2f}**
and daily growth rate of **{daily_growth_t:.2f}%**.
