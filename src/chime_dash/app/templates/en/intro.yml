description-total-infection: "
The estimated number of currently infected individuals is **{total_infections:.0f}**. This is based on current inputs for
Hospitalizations (**{current_hosp}**), Hospitalization rate (**{hosp_rate:.0%}**), Regional population (**{S}**),
and Hospital market share (**{market_share:.0%}**)."
infected-population-warning: "
(Warning: The number of estimated infections is greater than the total regional population. Please verify the values entered in the sidebar.)"
description-doubling-time: "
An initial doubling time of **{doubling_time}** days and a recovery time of **{recovery_days}** days imply an **`R0`** of
**{r_naught:.2f}** and daily growth rate of **{daily_growth:.2f}%**."
mitigation-rt-less-than-1: "
**Mitigation**: A **{relative_contact_rate:.0%}** reduction in social contact after the onset of the
outbreak **halves the infections every {doubling_time_t:.1f}** days, implying an effective **`R(t)`** of **{r_t:.2f}**
and daily growth rate of **{daily_growth_t:.2f}%**."
mitigation-rt-more-than-equal-1: "
**Mitigation**: A **{relative_contact_rate:.0%}** reduction in social contact after the onset of the
outbreak **reduces the doubling time to {doubling_time_t:.1f}** days, implying an effective **`R(t)`** of **{r_t:.2f}**
and daily growth rate of **{daily_growth_t:.2f}%**."
